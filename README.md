# web_service

A simple illustration of set theory in action, using a web API as the medium.

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

## Getting Started
If you don't have leiningen installed, take a look at
[its GitHub page](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

The fast start is to download [lein](https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein),
make it executable, put it in your path, and then follow the usage steps above.

## Caveats
There are no tests in the code. I really should add some in...
