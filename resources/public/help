example rest api for using-set-theory

this api is designed to highlight some uses of set theory in a real app. all urls
return json unless otherwise noted.

a note on the book format:
a book is a json object in the form
  { "title" : <book title as a string>,
    "authors": [<a list of the book authors as strings>],
    "summary": <a summary of the book as a string>,
    "formats": [the supported formats as a list of strings] }


urls:
	/api			    gets the api version
	/api/books		    get the list of all books in the sample library
	/api/books/titles	    get a list of all the titles in the sample library
	/api/books/title/:title     get the book with the title :title
	/api/books/formats	    get a list of supported formats
	/api/books/format/:format   get a list of all books in the :format format
	/api/books/authors	    get a list of all authors in the library
	/api/books/author/:author   get a list of all books by :author

    /api/books/format/:format
    /api/books/titles
    /api/books/title/:title
